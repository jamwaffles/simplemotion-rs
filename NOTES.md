TODO: Argon wiki has "parameter writing" mode which seems like a better bet than the buffered mode.

The PointToPoint example uses this mode apparently.

Which is here: https://github.com/GraniteDevices/SimpleMotionV2Examples/tree/master/PointToPointExample

But that seems to be a WIP example.

Seems that you can read/write registers with `SMP_` constants and `smReadParameter`/`smSetParameter` functions
